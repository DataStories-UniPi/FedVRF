# Federated Route Forecasting over Maritime Data Silos (FedVRF)
### Official Python implementation of the FedVRF model from the paper "Federated Vessel Route Forecasting over Maritime Data Silos"


# Installation 

In order to use FedVRF in your project, download all necessary modules in your directory of choice via pip or conda, and install their corresponding dependencies, as the following commands suggest:

```Python
# Using pip/virtualenv
pip install âˆ’r requirements.txt

# Using conda
conda install --file requirements.txt
```


# Usage

In order to discover encountering vessels and create the training dataset for VCRA, please consult the code in the notebook ```4-encountering-vessels.ipynb```

In order to train the VCRA model, please run the script ```5-comparing-with-related-work.py``` using the following arguments:

```
python 5-comparing-with-related-work.py --model mlp
```

To reproduce the experimental study of the paper, please execute the code in the notebooks ```5-comparing-with-related-work``` (quality of VCRA vs. related work), ```6-comparing-models-latency``` (response time of VCRA vs. related work), and ```7-model-transparency``` (VCRA model explainability).

In order to assess the collision risk of future encountering processes, one must first train a VRF model for predicting vessels' locations. Since VRF models can be deployed in a plug and play mode, one can use whatever VRF model he/she finds fit (e.g., [https://github.com/DataStories-UniPi/VLF_VRF](https://github.com/DataStories-UniPi/VLF_VRF)). Afterwards, for the predicted locations, run the code in the notebook ```8-vcrf-encountering-vessels-arrnn.ipynb``` in order to discover future encountering processes (along with their corresponding CRI) and reproduce the experimental study of VCRF as well.
